Package: accel-config
Section: misc
Architecture: i386 amd64
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Description: Utility for configuring the DSA subsystem
 Intel Accelerator Utilities (accel-config) provides a user interface to the
 Intel Data Streaming Accelerator (DSA). DSA is a high-performance data copy
 and transformation accelerator integrated into Intel Xeon processors.
 .
 This package contains a utility for configuring the DSA (Data Stream
 Accelerator) subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Package: libaccel-config1
Architecture: i386 amd64
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Utility library wrapping the Intel DSA sysfs ABI. It provides
 access to work queues by using the mmap portal from the character device and
 send work to the accelerator. It also provides interfaces to manage virtual DSA
 devices exposed by the driver to the guest via VFIO mediated device framework.
 .
 This package contains a utility library for managing the DSA (Data Stream
 Accelerator) subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Package: libaccel-config-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: i386 amd64
Depends: libaccel-config1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for libaccel-config
 Header files and development library for compiling C programs to link with the
 libaccel-config library and manage the DSA subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Package: accel-config-test
Section: misc
Architecture: i386 amd64
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Description: Utility to test the DSA subsystem
 This utility has test cases that exercise the DSA subsysem. It uses
 libaccel-config API to configure workqueues and issues ENQCMD and MOVDIR64
 instructions to move memory.
