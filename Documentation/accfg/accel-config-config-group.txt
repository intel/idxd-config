accel-config config-group(1)
============================

NAME
----
accel-config-config-group - configure individual attributes of a group

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'accel-config config-group <device name>/<group name> [<options>]'

EXAMPLE
-------
accel-config config-group dsa0/group0.0 --read-buffers-reserved=1

OPTIONS
-------
-r::
--read-buffers-reserved=::
	specify the number of read buffers reserved for the use of engines
	in the group. The limit of this value must be:
	- The sum of all read-buffers-reserved for all groups must be less than or
	  equal to total read buffers from group capability field of the
	  device.

-t::
--read-buffers-allowed=::
	specify the maximum number of read buffers that may be in use at
	one time by all engines in the group. This value can be used to
	limit the maximum bandwidth used by engines in the group. The limit
	of this value must be:
	- greater than 0
	- greater than or equal to the read-buffers-reserved value for this group.
	- less than or equal to the sum of read-buffers reserved-field and the
	  non-reserved read buffers (total read buffers - total read buffers
	  reserved for all groups).

-l::
--use-read-buffer-limit=::
	toggle the enabling of read-buffer limt usage. use-read-buffer-limit should be
	either 0 or 1.

-a::
--traffic-class-a=::
	specify traffic class A for this group, it should be larger
	than 0 and less than 8.

-b::
--traffic-class-b=::
	specify traffic class B for this group, it should be larger
	than 0 and less than 8.

-d::
--desc-progress-limit=::
	Controls the number of work descriptors that can be concurrently
	processed by an engine in the group. Range of valid values are 0, 1, 2
	and 3 for max, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 respectively that the engine is capable
	of.

-p::
--batch-progress-limit=::
	Controls the number of batch descriptors that can be concurrently
	processed by an engine in the group. Range of valid values are 0, 1, 2
	and 3 for max, 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 respectively that the engine is capable
	of.
