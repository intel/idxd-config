=========================

NAME
----
accel-config-config-wq - configure individual attributes of a work queue

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'accel-config config-wq <device name>/<wq name> [<options>]'

EXAMPLE
-------
accel-config config-wq dsa0/wq0.0 --wq-size=16

OPTIONS
--------
-g::
--group-id=::
	specify the group id used by work queue, group id should be between 0
	and the maximum number of groups per device. A group id of -1
	disassociates the work queue from a group.

-s::
--wq-size=::
	specify work queue size used by a work queue. The wq-size should be
	between 0 and the maximum workqueue size exposed by the device in
	the max_work_queue_size attribute under device.

-p::
--priority::
	specify the priority of this work queue relative to other work queues
	in the same group. This field ranges from 1 to 15 where the larger
	value means higher priority. For example, if wq1 has a priority of
	6 and wq2 has priority of 2, wq1 will issue 3 times as many
	descriptors to the engine compare to wq2.

-b::
--block-on-fault::
	toggle block on fault enable for the work queue. block-on-fault
	should be either 0 or 1. If block on fault is disabled, if a
	page fault occurs on a source or destination memory access,
	the operation stops and the page fault is reported to the software.

-t::
--threshold::
	configure the threshold for the wq. The set up threshold value should be
	larger than 0 and only for "shared" wq, and note that the configured
	threshold value should be at least 1 less than the configured wq-size
	value. The reason is threshold is set for unprivileged users, and need
	to reserve at least 1 space for the privileged user for commands.

-y::
--type::
	configure the type for the wq. The wq type can be "kernel" for kernel
	use case to request wq, or "user" for regular character device driver
	use case to wq.

-m::
--mode::
	configure the mode for the wq. The wq mode can be set as "dedicated" or
	"shared".
